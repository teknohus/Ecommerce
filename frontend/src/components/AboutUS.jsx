              The first thing to keep in mind is that your About Us page is not
              just about you – it’s about what you can do for potential
              customers, and why you should be the one to do it. Therefore,
              you’ll want to make sure you provide some background on both your
              products and your team. You’ll also want to emphasize the core
              values that make your company unique.
